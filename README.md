If there is a xml file for you and ask you to build up a application, how do you to do this impossible task? hopefully this project would help you.:)
<br/>
This project is a plugin architecture according a xml file(PluginConfig.xml):<br/>
In my consider, here are my propose: 
<ul>
	<li>I would like to make this project can adapt both Winform and WPF. right now is just adapt the Winform.</li>
	<li>I would like to create a server side, it can provider both core logic in service side.</li>
   <li>I would like the plugin also can deploy in the server side and download by the client exe into Plugin folder.</li>
	<li>thinking....</li>
</ul>
